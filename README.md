# Design-MSE2202B
I put a skeleton code on the base file 
create a new branch for you to work on
Copy that onto a ino file and add the main function to complete the major task you have been assigned under main functions
any sub functions should be put under sub functions
All variables/set should be put under the proper comment headlines
once your done make a pull request and we can peer edit before commiting it to the base
